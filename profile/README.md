## Open Catalyst Project
Using AI to model and discover new catalysts to address the energy challenges posed by climate change.

### BREAKING CHANGES
We have moved all of code development to our new org [Fair-Chem](https://github.com/FAIR-Chem).
The `ocp` modeling repository is now in [fairchem.core](https://github.com/FAIR-Chem/fairchem/tree/main/src/fairchem/core).
