## Open Catalyst Project (deprecated organization)
Using AI to model and discover new catalysts to address the energy challenges posed by climate change.

### DEPRECATION NOTICE
We have moved all of code development to our new org [Fair-Chem](https://github.com/FAIR-Chem).
The `ocp` ML model repository is now in [fairchem.core](https://github.com/FAIR-Chem/fairchem/tree/main/src/fairchem/core).

Please see the [new documentation website https://fair-chem.github.io/](https://fair-chem.github.io/) for details on how to use:
* the OCP/ODAC datasets
* the OCP API
* CatTsunami and AdsorbML
* and more!
